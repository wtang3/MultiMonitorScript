MultiMonitorScript
==================

Silly script I wrote when I was bored. This script will enable my TV and sound. 
Before I had to change my screen resolution, then enable my sound, but this speeds it up a bit. :P

Bat file -> runs monitorscript.pl

monitorscript.pl -> checks status of tv, and enables it and sound accordingly.
